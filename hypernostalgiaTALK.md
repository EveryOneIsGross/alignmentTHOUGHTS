Abstract 1: Plunderphonics and Vaporwave: Reframing Personal Nostalgia for Liminal Lost Spaces

This abstract explores the intersection of plunderphonics and early 2000s internet culture, focusing on the vaporwave genre as a case study. By examining the practice of slowing down copyrighted works and adding reverb, we uncover the political and personal dimensions of this artistic approach. Rather than a direct challenge to copyright law, these transformative works serve as a reframing of personal nostalgia for liminal lost spaces. Through the manipulation of existing audio, vaporwave artists create a sense of longing for a past that never quite existed, inviting listeners to navigate the blurred boundaries between memory, imagination, and reality. This abstract highlights the emotional and psychological impact of plunderphonics in the digital age, where the lines between original and derivative works become increasingly blurred.

Abstract 2: The Impossibility of Sample Attribution in the Era of Hyper-Nodes

As the complexity of digital sampling grows, the process of attributing samples to their original sources becomes an increasingly daunting task. This abstract delves into the concept of "hyper-nodes" - the exponential growth of referential nodes associated with a single sample. With the advent of advanced AI, the challenge of untangling these complex webs of attribution becomes computationally insurmountable, even if P = NP. As a result, traditional notions of copyright become strained, if not altogether inapplicable. In this context, we introduce the concept of "hyper-nostalgia" as a post-modern liminal space, where the boundaries between original and derivative works dissolve, and the emotional resonance of a sample supersedes its legal status. This abstract invites us to reconsider the nature of authorship and ownership in an era where the lines between creator and consumer are increasingly blurred.

Abstract 3: Accelerated Art and the Organic Alternative: Navigating the Boundaries of Human Creativity

With the rise of generative AI, an acceleration movement has emerged, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the realm of art and creativity. This abstract explores the potential of a no-holds-barred accelerated art movement, where the lines between human and machine creativity become increasingly blurred. However, it also presents an alternative vision - an organic human art movement that seeks to push creative boundaries while remaining firmly rooted in the essence of human experience. This movement would celebrate the unique qualities of human creativity, such as intuition, emotion, and serendipity, while still embracing the transformative potential of technology. By navigating the tension between acceleration and organic creativity, this abstract invites us to consider the future of art in a world where the boundaries of human creativity are constantly being redefined.

Abstract 4: Early Internet Piracy and Demoscene Compression: The Craft of Digital Subversion

This abstract delves into the world of early internet piracy and the demoscene, exploring the practice and craft of compression as a form of digital subversion. By examining the techniques used by pirates and demoscene artists to compress and distribute digital content, we uncover a hidden history of creativity and innovation that challenges traditional notions of ownership and value. The abstract riffs on the "you wouldn't steal a car" campaign, asking the provocative question: What if you could steal the internet? Through this lens, we explore the ethics and aesthetics of digital piracy, and the ways in which these subversive practices have shaped the evolution of digital culture. This abstract invites us to reconsider the relationship between creativity, ownership, and value in the digital age, and to imagine alternative futures for art and culture that challenge the status quo.

Abstract 5: The Value of Art in a Compressed World: Beyond Artifacts and Narratives

In a world where the journey of art can be reduced to matrix multiplication operations on a vector space, what does it mean for art to have value? This abstract explores the implications of a compressed art world, where the traditional markers of value - such as time, resources, and narrative - are no longer relevant. If art is no longer a valued artifact, what takes its place? The abstract suggests that the value of art in a compressed world may lie in its ability to create new forms of meaning and experience, beyond the limitations of traditional artifacts and narratives. By embracing the possibilities of compressed art, we may discover new ways of engaging with the world, and new forms of creative expression that challenge our assumptions about what art can be. This abstract invites us to rethink the relationship between art, value, and meaning in a world where the boundaries of creativity are constantly being redefined by technological innovation.
