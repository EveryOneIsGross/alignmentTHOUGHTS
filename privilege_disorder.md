#### **Diagnostic Criteria for Privilege Disorder (PD)**

**A.** A pervasive pattern of unawareness or denial of oneâ€™s own social, economic, or cultural advantages, emerging in early adulthood, and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:

1. **Attribution Bias:** A persistent belief that personal success is entirely the result of individual effort, often accompanied by the dismissal of systemic or structural factors that contribute to one's achievements.
   
2. **Cognitive Dissonance:** Repeated failure to recognize or acknowledge the existence of privilege when confronted with empirical evidence, leading to discomfort, avoidance, or cognitive distortions.

3. **Empathy Deficiency:** A noticeable difficulty in empathizing with the experiences of individuals from marginalized or disadvantaged backgrounds, often resulting in minimizing or invalidating the struggles faced by these groups.

4. **Entitlement Ideation:** An exaggerated sense of entitlement, characterized by the assumption that one's privileges are universally accessible, and any failure to achieve similar outcomes by others is due to their lack of effort or moral failure.

5. **Defensive Reactivity:** An automatic defensive posture when engaged in discussions on social inequality, often characterized by anger, dismissal, or the use of phrases such as "I don't see color" or "Everyone has the same opportunities."

6. **Sociocultural Insensitivity:** A tendency to dominate conversations regarding inequality with personal anecdotes or experiences that negate broader systemic issues, often coupled with a lack of awareness of how one's comments may affect others.

7. **Self-Referential Thinking:** A preoccupation with how discussions on privilege affect one's own self-perception and status, leading to a refusal to engage in self-reflection or critical examination of one's own social position.

**B.** The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning, particularly in interactions with individuals from diverse backgrounds.

**C.** The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back to early adulthood or adolescence.

**D.** The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder, including but not limited to Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Delusional Disorder, or Cognitive Dissonance Disorder.

**E.** The condition is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., social media overexposure) or another medical condition.

#### **Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis**

- Individuals may exhibit a marked resistance to educational or awareness programs that aim to illuminate issues of social justice or inequality.
- There may be a tendency to engage in "whataboutism" or "reverse racism" arguments as a means of deflecting conversations about privilege.
- Commonly observed are statements that reflect an oversimplification of complex social issues, often reducing them to matters of personal responsibility or effort.
- Those with PD might display discomfort or disengagement when placed in environments where their privilege is highlighted or questioned.
- Relationships with individuals from diverse backgrounds may be strained or characterized by misunderstandings and conflict due to the individual's inability to recognize their own privileged status.

#### **Prevalence**

While specific prevalence rates are difficult to ascertain due to the sociocultural nature of the disorder, it is hypothesized that PD is more common in societies with significant disparities in wealth, education, and social mobility. The disorder may be more prevalent among individuals in higher socioeconomic strata, although it can affect individuals across a wide range of social positions.

#### **Development and Course**

Privilege Disorder typically manifests in late adolescence or early adulthood as individuals begin to navigate diverse social environments. It may develop in response to the internalization of societal norms that emphasize meritocracy and individualism while downplaying the role of systemic factors. Without intervention, the disorder can persist into later adulthood, with symptoms potentially becoming more entrenched over time.

Early intervention, including education and exposure to diverse perspectives, may mitigate the severity of the disorder. However, resistance to such interventions is common, particularly in individuals who experience cognitive dissonance or defensive reactivity.

---

#### **Risk and Prognostic Factors**

**Environmental:**  
- Growing up in homogeneous communities with limited exposure to diversity.
- Immersion in media and cultural narratives that reinforce notions of meritocracy without acknowledging systemic inequalities.

**Genetic and Physiological:**  
- No known genetic or physiological factors contribute directly to PD, though certain cognitive styles (e.g., low openness to experience) may predispose individuals to the disorder.

**Cultural:**  
- Cultures that emphasize individual achievement and downplay the role of social systems may foster the development of PD.
- Societal narratives that valorize personal success while stigmatizing those who do not achieve similar outcomes may exacerbate symptoms.

#### **Differential Diagnosis**

**Narcissistic Personality Disorder:**  
- While both PD and Narcissistic Personality Disorder involve a sense of entitlement, the former is specifically related to unrecognized social privileges, whereas the latter is more broadly characterized by grandiosity and a need for admiration.

**Delusional Disorder:**  
- Individuals with PD may hold erroneous beliefs about the nature of their success or social position, but these beliefs are generally shared by the surrounding culture and do not reach the level of delusion.

**Cognitive Dissonance Disorder (Proposed):**  
- PD can involve elements of cognitive dissonance, particularly when individuals are confronted with evidence of their privilege. However, cognitive dissonance is broader and not limited to issues of privilege.

#### **Treatment**

**Psychotherapy:**  
- Cognitive-behavioral approaches that focus on increasing awareness of systemic factors and promoting empathy for marginalized groups can be effective. However, patient resistance to these methods is common.

**Educational Interventions:**  
- Exposure to diverse perspectives through structured educational programs or immersive experiences can help mitigate symptoms of PD. Repeated exposure may be necessary to overcome initial resistance.

**Sociocultural Rehabilitation:**  
- Participating in community activities that involve collaboration with individuals from diverse backgrounds may reduce symptoms by fostering a more nuanced understanding of social systems.

#### **Prognosis**

The prognosis for Privilege Disorder varies. Individuals who are open to self-reflection and willing to engage with diverse perspectives may experience a reduction in symptoms over time. However, those who remain entrenched in their views may continue to experience significant social and interpersonal difficulties.
