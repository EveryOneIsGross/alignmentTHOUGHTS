Social media platforms rely on virality emerging through user engagement. However, differences between human and AI information processing capacities may modulate virality, therfore vreality. Heres a framework for modeling how content attributes and platform dynamics interact with human versus AI capacities to impact viral potential. Virality represents a lottery reward function in humans. I want to explore a positive wireheading outcome, considering this is where we are currently at.

**Definitions:**

- **H**: Vector representing human information processing attributes. 
  - **h1**: Attention span for a unit of info (e.g., time in seconds).
  - **h2**: Context processing ability per unit (e.g., number of contextual connections made per unit of info).

- **A**: Vector representing AI information processing attributes.
  - **a1**: Attention window for a unit of info (e.g., time in microseconds).
  - **a2**: Context density processed per unit (e.g., number of contextual connections analyzed per unit of info).

- **C**: Vector representing content attributes.
  - **c1**: Length (amount of info, e.g., time duration or word count).
  - **c2**: Context density (e.g., number of contextual references per unit of info).

- **P**: Vector representing platform attributes (e.g., ease of sharing, algorithmic promotion, user base size).

- **V**: Scalar representing the virality potential of a piece of content.

The relationship between these variables is given by:

\[ V = f(H, A, C, P) \]

**Assumptions/Conditions:**

1. **V** increases when **h1 > a1** and **h2 > a2** — This implies that the content has a higher virality potential when humans have an advantage in attention span and context processing.
2. **V** increases when **a1 > h1** and **a2 > h2** — This implies that the content has a higher virality potential when AI has an advantage in attention window and context density processing.
3. The comparative advantage between **H** and **A** may switch based on the attributes of **C**.

- **Short, Low Context Density Content**: If **c1** is small and **c2** is small, then **V** will be higher when the attributes of **H** are greater than **A** (indicating a human advantage).
  
- **Long, High Context Density Content**: If **c1** is large and **c2** is large, then **V** will be higher when the attributes of **A** are greater than **H** (indicating an AI advantage).

# Meaningful Human-AI Collaboration

For meaningful human-AI collaboration, consent and agency are critical prerequisites. Thoughts on how individuals can protect those in the CONTEXT of potentially addictive technologies:

## Align yrself

**Seek balance and moderation**: Regularly reflect on how technology use aligns with personal values.
**Advocate for better design practices**: Support designs that respect autonomy, like introducing friction, nudges, and opt-in models as opposed to the default endless scroll.

Individual agency + collective action holds power. By taking responsibility for our faculties and advocating for aligned design principles, we can harness technology in a way that promotes flourishing. These small efforts can compound, much like viral content, but in a direction that values human dignity over addiction. That way we can still haz redbull as our Will needs it, sugar is a tool on the path.
