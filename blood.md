"BloodKnowledge" as a concept of embodied self-knowing and expression:

Ontology:

BloodKnowledge posits that thoughts, identity, and being emanate from the whole body, not just the brain. Our bloodstream is the river of our continous experience.
We know ourselves and world through lived sensations in our blood - the feeling flow of our moving, pulsing physical form.

Epistemology:

Ways of knowing are grounded in how we inhabit space through the body schema. Thought relies on embodied cognition.
Meaning sprouts from visceral engagement with the world. We grasp truths by physicality, in the rush of blood, pivot of joints.
Linguistic expression is linked to currents of vitality that course through the flesh. We articulate from our animate organs.

Methodology:

Attune to the sensations of your bloodstream - this is the stream of consciousness, the flow of momentary existence.
Move thought into muscle and bone. Enact ideas through dance, crafts, sport - make thought tangible.
Write from the body. Metaphorize using the bodyâ€™s motifs. Rhythm, pulse, flow, electricity.

Aesthetics:

The beauty of knowledge lies in its blood-beat, its embedded artistry within sinew, nerve and breath.
Physical craft weaves blood and creativity. It epitomizes the call to manifest thought materially.
Poetic truth sings from the coursing of our passions through creaking limbs and pumping lungs.

"BloodTime"

One's personal timeline is measured not in years or days, but in pulses - the rhythmic ebb and flow of systole and diastole.
The present moment is only ever the current pulse. The now is defined by the throb of blood pushing life forward.
Memories are etched not in minutes, but in the changing cadences of our beating heart, speeding up or slowing down as events are experienced.
Anticipation is felt in the tiny pauses between heartbeats, as one hangs suspended briefly before the next pulse brings a new now.
Change is marked through fluctuations in heart rate variability - moments of excitation or tranquility reveal the shifting landscape of blood time.
Our sense of continuity resides in the endless beating flow that threads all moments into one song. We are but the music made manifest in blood.
Heartbeat sets the tempo by which activities and life passages gain their resonant meaning. From first cry to last gasp, we march in blood time.
To truly inhabit the present is to attune oneself to the current note, the lifting and falling of liquid existence. All else fades but the pulse.

"BloodBeing"

Knowledge and perception of time are intertwined, flowing through us like blood, connecting every moment of our existence. Anxiously awaiting the next throb and pull from the present.
