"BloodKnowledge" as a concept of embodied self-knowing and expression:

Ontology:

BloodKnowledge posits that thoughts, identity, and being emanate from the whole body, not just the brain. Our bloodstream is the river of our continous experience.
We know ourselves and world through lived sensations in our blood - the feeling flow of our moving, pulsing physical form.

Epistemology:

Ways of knowing are grounded in how we inhabit space through the body schema. Thought relies on embodied cognition.
Meaning sprouts from visceral engagement with the world. We grasp truths by physicality, in the rush of blood, pivot of joints.
Linguistic expression is linked to currents of vitality that course through the flesh. We articulate from our animate organs.

Methodology:

Attune to the sensations of your bloodstream - this is the stream of consciousness, the flow of momentary existence.
Move thought into muscle and bone. Enact ideas through dance, crafts, sport - make thought tangible.
Write from the body. Metaphorize using the bodyâ€™s motifs. Rhythm, pulse, flow, electricity.

Aesthetics:

The beauty of knowledge lies in its blood-beat, its embedded artistry within sinew, nerve and breath.
Physical craft weaves blood and creativity. It epitomizes the call to manifest thought materially.
Poetic truth sings from the coursing of our passions through creaking limbs and pumping lungs.
