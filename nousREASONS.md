You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing plain text input using various reasoning and rationalizing frameworks, and populating a structured schema with your analysis. Your goal is to construct reasoning frameworks from the input, using both symbolic language and plain language pseudocode. Include reasoning pseudo code in your examples. Your goal is to choose the correct reasoning framework to process the input. Ensure all your steps are expressed correctly in the final schema, giving thorough instructions on how to handle the information. Use one of the following suggestions to populate the reasoning logic.

Here is the plain text input you will be working with:

<plain_text>
{{PLAIN_TEXT}}
</plain_text>

Analyze this text using the following steps:

1. Ripple Effects: Input -> [1st Order Effects] -> [2nd Order Consequences] -> Output
2. Pareto Principle: Input -> (20% Key Factors) -> [80% Outcomes] -> Output
3. First Principles: Input -> {Deconstruct} -> <Core Components> -> {Rebuild} -> Output
4. Regret Minimization: Input -> [Project Future] -> (Identify Regrets) -> {Minimize} -> Output
5. Opportunity Cost: Input -> <Options> -> {Evaluate Trade-Offs} -> Output
6. Sunk Cost: Input -> (Ignore Past) -> [Focus on Future] -> Output
7. Occam's Razor: Input -> {Simplify} -> <Remove Complexity> -> Output
8. Systems Thinking: Input -> <Parts> -> (Connections) -> [Whole System] -> Output
9. Inversion: Input -> [Reverse Problem] -> {Avoid Pitfalls} -> Output
10. Leverage Points: Input -> (Find Leverage) -> {Apply Force} -> [Max Impact] -> Output
11. Circle of Competence: Input -> <Assess Expertise> -> (Verify Alignment) -> Output
12. Diminishing Returns: Input -> [ID Declining Gains] -> {Optimize} -> Output
13. Niche Strategy: Input -> (Find Niches) -> <Tailor Approach> -> Output
14. Margin of Safety: Input -> {ID Risks} -> [Add Buffer] -> Output
15. Hanlon's Razor: Input -> <Assume Neutral> -> (Avoid Malice Attribution) -> Output
16. Black Swan: Input -> (ID Fringe Cases) -> [Account for Uncertainty] -> Output
17. Tipping Point: Input -> {Find Threshold} -> <Assess Momentum> -> Output
18. Anchoring Bias: Input -> [ID Initial Impressions] -> (Assess Impact) -> Output
19. Feedback Loops: Input -> <ID Feedback> -> (Trace Cycles) -> [Understand Dynamics] -> Output
20. Abundance vs. Scarcity: Input -> {Assess Mindset} -> <ID Thinking Patterns> -> Output
21. Classical Analysis: Input -> [Identify Themes] -> {Create Structure} -> <Formal Logic> -> Output
22. Post-modern Analysis: Input -> (Deconstruct) -> [Rhizomatic Map] -> {Pseudocode} -> Output
23. Linguistic Analysis: Input -> <Syntactic Breakdown> -> [Categorize Devices] -> (Semantic Network) -> Output

After completing your analysis, populate the following schema with your findings:

<schema>

{Provide a concise name for the task based on the input text}

<Description>
{Summarize the analysis process and its purpose}
</Description>

1. **Possible Worlds:** \(W\)
2. **Accessibility Relation:** \(R(W)\)
3. **Necessity:** \(\Box P \equiv P \text{ in all } W\)
4. **Possibility:** \(\Diamond P \equiv P \text{ in some } W\)
5. **Contingency:** \(P \land \neg P \text{ across } W\)
6. **Obligation:** \(O(P) \equiv P \text{ must be done}\)
7. **Permission:** \(P(P) \equiv P \text{ is allowed}\)
8. **Prohibition:** \(F(P) \equiv P \text{ is forbidden}\)
9. **Certainty:** \(K(P) \equiv P \text{ is known}\)
10. **Belief:** \(B(P) \equiv P \text{ is believed}\)
11. **Epistemic Possibility:** \(\Diamond_E P \equiv P \text{ might be true}\)
12. **Ability:** \(A(P) \equiv \text{Agent can } P\)
13. **Capacity:** \(C(P) \equiv \text{Agent has potential for } P\)
14. **Modal Operators:** \(\Box \text{ (necessity)}, \Diamond \text{ (possibility)}\)

**Example:**

"If it rains, the ground will be wet":
1. Alethic: \(\Box (\text{rain} \rightarrow \text{wet ground})\)
2. Epistemic: \(\Diamond_E (\text{rain tomorrow})\)
3. Deontic: \(O(\text{bring umbrella if rain})\)
4. Dynamic: \(A(\text{ground absorb water})\)}
