Conversational Context in Chatbot Architectures used for Alzheimer's and Dementia Patients

---

If the technology used for augmenting conversational context in chatbot architectures is tailored for a specific use case, such as tracking the conversations of dementia and Alzheimer's patients and providing them with summarized reminders of ongoing events, it could potentially enhance their memory retention and recollection, thereby improving their conversational fluency and overall cognitive function.

Rationale: The memory deficits associated with Alzheimer's and dementia often manifest in the patients' conversations. They can lose track of the context, forget what they've previously mentioned, or fail to recall recent events. Utilizing the technology of conversational context augmentation, currently applied in chatbots, could be a novel approach to address these issues.

By continuously tracking and maintaining the context of conversations with patients, the chatbots could:

Provide real-time summaries: The chatbot could generate regular summaries of the ongoing conversation or event, reinforcing the patients' memory and helping them to keep up with the conversation.

Offer context-based reminders: If the patient loses the thread of the conversation, the chatbot could gently remind them of the key points they have discussed, helping to maintain conversational continuity.

Assist with memory recall: By referencing recent conversations, the chatbot could prompt memory recall, potentially exercising and strengthening the patients' memory functions.

The hypothesis, therefore, postulates that tailored chatbots equipped with this technology could act as conversational companions for dementia and Alzheimer's patients, improving their conversational abilities and overall cognitive function.
