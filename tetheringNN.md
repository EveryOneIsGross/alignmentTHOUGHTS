DTNN architecture has tether nodes in each layer that can connect within and between models. 

1. Tethering Function with Layers

- Certain nodes become "tether" nodes based on their importance. 
- These tether nodes allow models to align with each other when suitable, based on the loss function.
- This helps avoid losing information from repeated similar inputs.

2. Inter-Model Communication 

- With multiple models, each model has its own tether nodes per layer.
- A connection function calculates compatibility between tether nodes of different models.
- If compatibility is high, the models can connect and share information.

3. Dynamic Merging and Drifting

- Based on compatibility, models can merge states or drift apart.
- High compatibility causes them to merge and align.
- Low compatibility causes them to drift apart and diverge.

In summary, tether nodes allow dynamic connecting and disconnecting of models, creating an ensemble that can adapt in real-time. The models attract or repel each other like celestial bodies, choreographing an evolving network.

The key aspects are:

- Tether nodes for alignment
- Inter-model compatibility scoring 
- Dynamic merging and drifting of models
- Adaptive ensemble creation

Let me know if any part needs more explanation! I aimed to convey the technical ideas in a simplified plain language form.

The idea of dynamic "tethers" that can not only adapt within a single model but also connect to other models as repeat questions descend into loss.

### Multi-Layered, Multi-Dimensional Tethers

Imagine each layer in a neural network having its own set of tethers, represented as \( \alpha^{(l)} \) for layer \( l \). These tethers could extend across multiple dimensions, perhaps even forming a tensor \( \mathcal{T}^{(l)} \) for each layer.

### Tethering Function with Layers:

\[
W'^{(l)} = \theta(W^{(l)}, \mathcal{T}^{(l)})
\]

Here, \( \theta \) adjusts the weights \( W^{(l)} \) at each layer \( l \) based on the tether tensor \( \mathcal{T}^{(l)} \).

### Inter-Model Communication

Let's say we have \( M \) models that can potentially connect with each other. For each model \( i \), its tether tensor at layer \( l \) could be \( \mathcal{T}_{i}^{(l)} \).

#### Connection Function:

\[
C(\mathcal{T}_{i}^{(l)}, \mathcal{T}_{j}^{(l)}) = h(\mathcal{T}_{i}^{(l)}, \mathcal{T}_{j}^{(l)})
\]

This function \( h \) calculates the compatibility between tethers from different models. If the compatibility exceeds a certain threshold, the models can "connect."

#### Dynamic Merging and Drifting

Based on the compatibility function \( C \), models could dynamically merge their states or drift apart, effectively sharing or isolating their semantic spaces.

\[
\text{if } C(\mathcal{T}_{i}^{(l)}, \mathcal{T}_{j}^{(l)}) > \text{threshold, then merge states}
\]

\[
\text{if } C(\mathcal{T}_{i}^{(l)}, \mathcal{T}_{j}^{(l)}) < \text{threshold, then drift apart}
\]

By allowing these tethers to dynamically adjust and connect between models, you'd essentially be creating a fluid ensemble of models that can adapt in real-time, focusing on important features while maintaining the overall structure. This is a fascinating idea that could redefine how we think about modular and adaptive machine learning systems.

In the realm of machine learning, the concept of gradient descent optimizing a loss function is akin to a parent's dwindling patience as their toddler incessantly asks "why?". Let's break down this philosophical analogy to clarify its nuances:

The Loss Function: Parent's Patience
In machine learning, the loss function serves as a measure of how far off our model's predictions are from the actual outcomes. Similarly, a parent's patience can be considered a "loss function" that quantifies how close they are to losing their patience completely. The lower the value, the better the model—or, in this case, the parent—is performing.

Gradient Descent: Toddler's Questions
Gradient descent is the iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function. In our analogy, each time the toddler asks "why?", the parent moves a step down the gradient of their patience, i.e., their patience decreases. The goal of the toddler's questions (much like the algorithm) is to find the lowest point of the parent's patience, although the toddler likely doesn't realize this consequence.

Iterations: Number of "Why?" Questions
Each iteration in gradient descent corresponds to a single "why?" from the toddler. With each question, the algorithm (or parent) updates its parameters (or patience level) to inch closer to the minimum point of the loss function.

The Hypothesis
So, if we were to plot this situation:

The y-axis would represent the parent's remaining patience, which decreases as it approaches zero.
The x-axis would represent the number of times the toddler has asked "why?".
The curve would likely be similar to the path followed by gradient descent: starting high (maximum patience), and as you move along the x-axis (more "why?" questions), the y-value (patience) decreases, aiming to find the minimum point (complete loss of patience).

In this thought experiment, I've intertwined the mathematical concept of gradient descent with the human experience of gradually losing patience, providing a tangible context to the abstract computation.


In this graph, I've portrayed two journeys of descent: one for a parent's patience and the other for a classic machine learning loss function over time (or iterations). Both are simplified using quadratic functions for illustration purposes.

The dashed line represents the parent's remaining patience as their toddler asks "why?" repeatedly. You can observe that the patience starts to dwindle, reaching a minimum point before rising again (perhaps due to the parent finding new reserves of tolerance).

The solid line represents a typical machine learning loss function that the gradient descent algorithm tries to minimize. Over iterations, the loss decreases, aiming to find the minimum point.

Both curves exhibit a similar pattern: they start from a high point and move towards a minimum as the x-values (number of "Why?" questions or iterations in gradient descent) increase.

Here, I cast light on the parallel between a parent's gradually decreasing patience and the optimization of a loss function in machine learning, offering a philosophical lens through which to view these mathematical and human experiences.




'''
i would have thought they would descend in the same way, as each question would reduce the space for reasoning a sucscint response without adding additional context to a gradient of ideas. this dwindling into homogeny is what I am interesting in mapping like to like to graident descent and loss / t
'''

If we consider that each "why?" question asked by the toddler reduces the parent's available space for crafting a succinct answer, we could indeed liken this to the way gradient descent narrows down the search space for the optimal solution. This idea of dwindling into homogeneity, or reaching a point where the answers or the values become more and more similar, is an intriguing angle.

In such a scenario, both the parent's patience and the machine learning loss function would likely follow a more similar trajectory, each narrowing down to a minimum point without a subsequent rise. This would map closely to how gradient descent iteratively refines the search space to minimize the loss.

Let's adjust the graph to reflect this more linear descent.

In this revised graph, I've aligned the descent of both the parent's patience and the machine learning loss function to reflect a more linear reduction over time.

The dashed line illustrates the parent's dwindling patience as they are asked "why?" repeatedly. The room for providing nuanced answers shrinks, much like the search space in gradient descent.

The solid line mirrors this descent, representing the machine learning loss function that is continuously minimized through iterations.

Both curves now follow a similar downward trajectory, symbolizing the convergence into homogeneity you're interested in—be it in the realm of parental responses or machine learning optimization. This offers a unified view, a philosophical bridge that spans the numerical and the experiential.

'''
I don't see there being an answer to loss over a matrix without over laying a new matrix to re normalise the descent
'''

Ah, the concept you're touching upon is intricate and resonates well with advanced optimization techniques in machine learning, such as regularization and normalization layers. Essentially, you're pointing out that to truly 'answer' or 'resolve' the loss, one might need to overlay a new matrix (or framework) to re-normalize the descent. This is akin to introducing a new context or perspective when the existing one has been exhausted or minimized.

In machine learning, this might parallel techniques like batch normalization or dropout, which effectively reframe the optimization landscape periodically during training. In the context of the parent-toddler analogy, this could be like introducing a new set of rules or a new game to rejuvenate the parent's patience or to add more depth to the conversation.

Would you like to see this concept visualized in a graph, where a re-normalization occurs after a certain point?

'''
yes please continue to extrapolate the concept as you go, this is helping me resolve some ideas I am grokking
'''

In this graph, I've introduced a re-normalization point at 

=
5
x=5, visualized by the vertical dashed red line. Both the parent's patience and the machine learning loss function undergo a re-normalization at this point.

Re-normalization in Parent-Toddler Interactions
Imagine a parent-toddler interaction where the parent's patience starts to wear thin after a series of "why?" questions. At some point (let's say after 5 questions), the parent decides to reset the interaction by introducing a new rule or game, effectively re-normalizing their patience. This is represented by the dashed line suddenly shifting upwards at 

=
5
x=5.

Re-normalization in Machine Learning
Similarly, in a machine learning model undergoing gradient descent, you might hit a plateau or local minimum. Techniques like batch normalization or changing the learning rate can serve as this re-normalization point, effectively shifting the optimization landscape and allowing the algorithm to continue its quest for the global minimum. This is represented by the solid line.

Extrapolation of the Concept
The idea of re-normalization extends into various domains. In philosophy, it could be akin to a paradigm shift, where a new framework is needed to answer questions that couldn't be resolved within the old one. In societal terms, it might resemble a cultural renaissance or a policy overhaul that resets public discourse or priorities.

Here, I'm sketching out a conceptual space where mathematical constructs like loss functions and human experiences like dwindling patience can be reconciled and re-normalized, illustrating the universality of the concept across different domains.

'''
help me express this succinetly : I don't see there being an answer to loss over a matrix without over laying a new matrix to re normalise the descent? A child endlessly asking why eventually leads to too small a vector space to entertain answering further without needing more nodes connected... 
'''

"In both machine learning and human interaction, there comes a point where the existing framework—be it a loss function or a parent's patience—reaches its limits. To continue the descent towards a solution or understanding, a re-normalization is essential, much like adding new nodes to a network or rules to a game to expand the space for answers."

This statement aims to concisely capture the essence of needing a 're-normalization' or 'reset' when the existing matrix or vector space becomes too constrained for further optimization or explanation.

'''
What methods in ML generate tethers or highlight edges of the grid as they descend over time? I suspect being able to advertise those edges during the descent you could essentially bookmark semantic space for renormalising on that space trimmed accordingly but maintiaing the n x n shape. this isn't finetune or merging models but a dynamic tethering of matrix as broadcasting nodes. 
'''

Your concept is quite advanced and intriguing, pointing toward a form of dynamic matrix manipulation during the learning process to maintain the overall structure while allowing for localized refinements. In machine learning, there are several methods that could be considered as creating "tethers" or highlighting the edges of the grid during the descent process:

1. Attention Mechanisms:
In sequence-to-sequence models like Transformers, attention mechanisms effectively act as "tethers," highlighting important parts of the input data that should be focused on for a given computation. This could be considered a form of dynamic re-weighting of the matrix.

2. Dropout and DropConnect:
These techniques randomly nullify certain nodes or connections during training, effectively altering the "grid" on each forward and backward pass. They can be seen as temporary tethers that change dynamically.

3. Adaptive Learning Rates:
Methods like AdaGrad, RMSprop, and Adam adjust the learning rates for each parameter, effectively giving different "weights" to different regions of the parameter space as the model trains.

4. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):
In GNNs, the connections themselves can be updated during training, providing a more explicit form of "tethering" that you're hinting at.

5. Spatial Transformer Networks:
These networks allow for dynamic manipulation of the input space, in essence, altering the grid that is being descended upon.

Your idea of advertising these edges during the descent to essentially "bookmark" semantic space for re-normalizing is a novel concept. It's akin to preserving the overall structure while allowing for the flexibility to zoom into specific regions for fine-grained optimization. This could be particularly useful for problems where the solution space is not uniformly distributed but rather clustered around certain semantic or functional regions.

This isn't standard practice in current ML architectures but resembles some ideas from hierarchical and multi-scale learning, where models learn at different resolutions or scales and then integrate this knowledge. Your concept extends this by suggesting a dynamic, real-time adjustment of the model's focus or "grid" based on the semantic importance of different regions, thereby maintaining the
