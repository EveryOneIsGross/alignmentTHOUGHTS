# Boustrophedon and Large Language Models: A Hypothesis on Context Preservation in Truncated Text

**Boustrophedon**, derived from Greek "βουστροφηδόν" (meaning "as the ox turns"), is an ancient writing style where lines alternate in reading direction. It mirrors the pattern an ox creates when plowing a field, reversing at the end of each row.

This study hypothesizes that boustrophedon can serve as a method to manage **token truncation** in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT. In the case of token truncation, the beginning and end of a text segment are removed, leaving only the middle portion. The central premise is that the boustrophedon style, due to its interlacing nature, could help retain more context within these truncated segments. 

In a boustrophedon paragraph divided into 'n' lines of equal length, each line potentially provides context for the ones before and after it, forming a 'n' x 'n' contextual matrix. If truncation occurs, the boustrophedon style could facilitate retrieval of some lost contextual information from adjacent lines, acting as a 'contextual chain'.

However, implementing this in practice comes with potential challenges:

1. **Model Retraining:** LLMs are trained to process text in a sequential manner. Retraining these models to read in a boustrophedon style may require substantial computational resources and a transformation of existing training data.

2. **Text Breaks:** Ensuring natural breaks at the end of each line could be difficult due to the variable sentence and word lengths in human languages. 

3. **Directionality of Languages:** Languages have defined directionality (e.g., English reads left-to-right). Alternating these directions could introduce unforeseen complexities in parsing and understanding the text.

If a paragraph is written in the boustrophedon style and subsequently truncated, an interesting aspect of context preservation may be observed. Assuming the paragraph is structured such that it's divided into 'n' lines of equal length, we could essentially consider each line as providing context for the lines immediately before and after it. 

In a normal left-to-right or right-to-left paragraph, if either the start or the end is truncated, the context is entirely lost. However, with boustrophedon, each line becomes a bridge to the line above and below it, creating a sort of 'contextual chain'. Therefore, if truncation occurs, some parts of the lost context could potentially be retrieved from the adjacent lines.

The usage of boustrophedon in ancient Greek inscriptions on stone tablets might provide an interesting historical context. While maximizing the available writing space could have been a primary reason for this style, a speculative hypothesis could be that the boustrophedon style served as a mechanism for context preservation in case a part of the tablet was damaged. Given the effort involved in engraving text onto stone, boustrophedon allows for the maximization of available space, as the engraver wouldn't need to return to the left side of the tablet for each new line. But in my thoughts if a part of the tablet was damaged, the boustrophedon style could provide a mechanism for preserving some of the context from the lost portion.

Designing an experiment to test this hypothesis would involve:

1. **Data Preparation:** Transforming a text corpus into boustrophedon format.

2. **Model Training:** Retraining a language model like GPT on the transformed data.

3. **Experiment Design:** Comparing the performance of the boustrophedon-trained model with a traditionally trained model on a token truncation task.

4. **Evaluation:** Defining evaluation metrics, analyzing results, and determining whether the boustrophedon style offers any performance advantages.
