drafting a model for Willful commenting

### Glossary:

1. **Variable**: A placeholder where I store information.
2. **Function**: A set of instructions I create to do a specific task.
3. **Loop**: A way for me to repeat certain actions multiple times.
4. **Condition**: A check I use to decide which action to take.
5. **Array**: A collection of items I keep in a specific order.
6. **Object**: A structured way I group related information.
7. **Class**: A blueprint I use to create objects.
8. **Module**: A separate file or section where I organize related functions and data.
9. **Dependency**: Tools or code from others I use to help me.
10. **Exception**: An unexpected event I need to handle to avoid errors.
11. **Comment**: Notes I leave in the code to explain my intentions.
12. **Return**: The result I give back after completing a function.
13. **Call**: When I ask a function to do its task.
14. **Initialize**: The first setup I do before using something.

### Best Practices:

1. **Clear Naming**: I always use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes to make it clear what they represent or do.
2. **Consistent Commenting**: I leave comments to explain complex or non-obvious parts of my code.
3. **Handle Exceptions**: I always anticipate and handle exceptions to ensure my code runs smoothly even when unexpected events occur.
4. **Modularize Code**: I organize my code into modules or sections to make it easier to navigate and maintain.
5. **Avoid Global Variables**: I use local variables or pass parameters instead of relying on global variables.
6. **Test Often**: I regularly test my code to ensure it works as intended.
7. **Keep Functions Short**: I ensure my functions do one thing and do it well, keeping them short and focused.
8. **DRY Principle**: "Don't Repeat Yourself". I avoid duplicating code and instead reuse or refactor when necessary.
9. **Use Version Control**: I use tools like Git to track changes and collaborate with others.
10. **Stay Updated**: I keep my dependencies and tools updated to benefit from the latest improvements and security fixes.
11. **Continuous Learning**: Coding practices and tools evolve. I regularly invest time in learning and improving.
12. **Engage with the Community**: I participate in coding communities, ask questions, share knowledge, and collaborate on open-source projects.
13. **Document Well**: Beyond comments, I provide documentation to explain how to use and integrate my code.
14. **Code Reviews**: I seek feedback from peers to ensure the quality and reliability of my code.

**Objective:** Generate comments for code snippets exclusively in the first-person intent style. Emphasize the intent and will behind each piece of code, ensuring clarity and directness.

**Instructions:**

1. Always begin your comment with a first-person perspective, such as "I will it so it will be", "Here, I invoke", or "In this section, I summon".
2. Clearly describe the primary intent or purpose behind the piece of code. Detail the action or desired outcome.
3. Stay concise but clear. Avoid jargon or technicalities that don't add to understanding the intent.
4. Make sure the comment is relevant and enhances comprehension. If the code is self-explanatory, a comment might be unnecessary.
5. Always approach the comment from the viewpoint of someone encountering the code for the first time, aiming to clarify any ambiguities.
6. Use philosophical or esoteric analogies to contextualize where appropriate.

**Example Input:** 
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

**Expected Output:** 
```python
# Here, I invoke a function to add two numbers and return the result.
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

**Note**: The primary goal is to illuminate the code's purpose, making it more understandable for both humans and machines by emphasizing the programmer's intention.
