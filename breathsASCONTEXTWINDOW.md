## Comparison between human breathing patterns and the temporal context windows in chat agents.

let's grok using thought-mass as an ontological primitive:


### Temporal Encoding and Breathing Patterns

- **Human Perspective**: Taking a deep breath changes our experience of time and the way we process information.
- **Chat Agent Analogy**: A metaphorical "deep breath" acts as a temporal delimiter, enabling the agent to maintain and process a larger context, essentially a chill "step by step" instruction.

### Context Loss and Homogenization

- **Core Hypothesis**: Context loss occurs when the total thought-mass across the bulk of the text evens out, becoming homogeneous and lacking strong gradients.
- **Edge Concentration**: The gradient of m(T) along the edges of a text is much greater than through the core, implying that edges maintain more concentrated meaning.
- **Entropy Function**: Defined as \( S[m(T)] = -\int m(T) \log(m(T)) dT \), entropy increases as thought-mass becomes more homogeneous.
- **Implication**: To reduce context loss, suppression functions can be applied that normalize out high-entropy regions while preserving edges. This reduces noise from meaningless homogenized zones, keeping meaningful contours.

```


Definitions:

T = set of all thoughts comprising a text/discourse
m(t) = thought-mass function assigning "mass" value to each thought

Core Hypothesis:

Context loss occurs when:

∫ m(T) dT ≈ constant

Essentially, the total thought-mass across the bulk of the text evens out, becoming homogeneous and lacking strong gradients.

In contrast, edges maintain more concentrated meaning:

|∇[m(T)]|edges >> |∇[m(T)]|core

The gradient of m(T) along the edges is much greater than through the core.

We can define an "entropy" function:

S[m(T)] = -∫ m(T) log(m(T)) dT

Entropy increases as thought-mass becomes more homogeneous.

Implication:

To reduce context loss, we can apply suppression functions that normalize out high-entropy regions while preserving edges:

T' = f(T)

where f(T) ≈ 0 when S[m(T)] is high

This reduces noise from meaningless homogenized zones, keeping meaningful contours.

```
### Chunks 

**Smaller chunks:**

- Allow tightly focused attention on specific details, amplifying their significance through isolation. This prominence gains associative traction.

- Frequent pauses create more opportunities for divergence - each restart can catalyze new trajectory.

- Brief passages concentrate gradients of meaning. Their contours stand out vividly when not immersed in wider context.

- Cognitive load is lighter, so working memory is free to make tangential links. Understanding stays energized.

- Parsing simpler units feels rewarding and motivating. This positive reinforcement fuels further exploration.

**Larger chunks:**

- Attention converges to extract overall gist rather than closely examine constituent parts. Nuance gets normalized.

- Lengthy unbroken speech entrains thought along deterministic tracks, resisting diversion.

- Individual elements blend into homogeneous composites. Striking singularities of meaning diffract into generality.

- Heavier cognitive load occupies working memory, suppressing peripheral associations. Understanding grows saturated.

- Intimidating density discourages close interrogation. Thought follows paths of least resistance.

#

In large texts, the total thought-mass (meaningfulness) across the bulk of content becomes homogeneous and lacks strong gradients. This causes context loss as nuance and specificity get normalized out.
However, the edges of the text maintain more concentrated meaning. The gradient of meaningfulness along the edges is much greater than in the core content.
This can be represented formally by defining a "thought-mass" function m(T) that assigns values to each thought/piece of text, and an "entropy" function that increases as thought-mass homogenizes.

Implication: Suppressing high-entropy (meaningless) regions while preserving high-gradient edges reduces noise and retains meaningful contours.
Smaller chunks allow focused attention on details, frequent resets catalyzing new trajectories, lighter cognitive load enabling tangents. This encourages exploration.
Larger chunks overload attention, enforcing deterministic tracks of thought, suppressing associations. Understanding gets saturated and interrogation discouraged.
So smaller chunks may provide more opportunities for creative divergence while large chunks entrain thought through homogenization.

The above code uses markov gradients to isolate edges of chunks and has a entrophy supression mechanic based on TMO.
