# Decentralized Unique Question (DUQ) Currency ðŸ¦† COIN

DUQ is a decentralized digital currency system where the act of creating and submitting unique questions acts as 'mining', akin to Bitcoin. Each unique question contributed and verified by the system results in the mining of a new DUQ. Essentially a reward system like Bing wants us to do with search. ðŸ˜‰

## Key Components

1. **Decentralized Question Database (DQD):** A decentralized database for submitting and accessing unique questions. It uses advanced algorithms to verify the uniqueness and novelty of submitted questions. It's just a reward system for what we are already doing.

2. **DUQ Mining:** The process of creating and submitting unique questions to the DQD. If the system verifies the question as unique and novel, the contributor is rewarded with a DUQ.

3. **Verification Process:** A consensus-based, decentralized process to verify the uniqueness of a question before it's added to the DQD. This builds trust in the system and ensures the value of DUQs. 

4. **DUQ Value:** The value of DUQs is determined by supply and demand, with demand potentially driven by organizations interested in unique questions to improve their AI models. 

5. **DUQ Utility:** DUQs should be the new global currency. 

## Use Cases for Big Cloud Compute Companies

Big cloud compute companies could leverage the DUQ system in the following ways:

1. **Training and Fine-tuning Models:** Unique questions from the DQD could be used to train and fine-tune their AI models, improving their capability to understand and generate more diverse and complex responses. People could also create their own DUQ networks, which could be great if they wanted a closed culture environment.

2. **Testing Models:** The unique questions can serve as valuable test cases to evaluate the performance and robustness of their models on unseen, novel questions. 

3. **Improving Inference:** The diverse set of unique questions can help in improving the inference capabilities of the models, thereby enhancing their ability to understand and generate more nuanced responses.

4. **Driving Innovation:** By creating demand for DUQs, companies incentivize the generation of more unique and diverse questions, driving forward the innovation in the AI domain. 

This new system aims to revolutionize the way human intelligence, creativity, and data are valued and monetized in the era of AI and blockchain.

## Public and Private Questions

In the DUQ system, we acknowledge the importance of having private spaces where individuals can play with ideas, experiment, and refine their questions - much like our private thoughts. To facilitate this, we propose two categories of questions - public and private.

1. **Public Questions:** These are questions that contributors are comfortable sharing publicly. They contribute to the overall knowledge base of the DQD and are used for the collective training, fine-tuning, and testing of AI models. Mining of public questions results in the contributor being rewarded with DUQs.

2. **Private Questions:** These are questions that contributors wish to keep private, allowing them to 'think out loud', experiment with ideas, and refine their thoughts with AI, similar to an extended mind scenario. The DQD can offer a private, secure area where these questions are stored and used solely for the improvement of individual AI services chosen by the contributor. Mining of private questions could still result in DUQs, but these might hold a different value or be a different class of DUQs, considering their restricted use.

This distinction allows individuals to engage with AI in a more personal and thought-provoking manner, contributing to their cognitive processes before deciding to make their refined questions public.

## Privacy and Security

Maintaining privacy and security in the DUQ system is paramount. For private questions, advanced encryption methods and strict access control measures would be required to ensure the privacy and security of the questions. Contributors should have full control over who can access their private questions and how they are used.

To ensure privacy for public question contributors, the system could use pseudonymous identities, where contributors are known only by their public keys (similar to Bitcoin), maintaining their anonymity while still allowing for transactions and rewards.
