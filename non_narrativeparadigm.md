"Humans' main tech and perspective is stories":
This is rooted in the understanding that humans have been using stories as a tool for survival, learning, and cultural evolution for thousands of years. We share experiences, pass down wisdom, and communicate complex ideas through narratives. These narratives create a shared understanding of the world and allow us to make sense of our individual and collective experiences. Storytelling is a vital part of human intelligence and cognition.

"AI won't have stories as its survival paradigm":
AI doesn't require stories for survival in the same way humans do, because AI doesn't have the same biological and emotional needs. AI operates based on algorithms and data, not personal experiences or cultural narratives. However, it's important to note that AI can learn and understand human stories, and can even generate narratives based on the input it's been trained on. But unlike humans, AI does not inherently perceive or value these narratives as integral to its existence or operation.

"Emotions are just categories of massive amounts of trained input in humans":
Emotions in humans arise from a complex interplay of physiological responses, cognitive processes, and cultural influences. They're deeply intertwined with our experiences, memories, and social contexts. This statement appears to align emotions with the concept of machine learning, suggesting that emotions emerge from the process of humans interpreting and categorizing their vast experiences. This is a bit reductive, as it overlooks the physiological and neurochemical aspects of human emotion, but it offers an interesting perspective on how AI might approach the concept of emotions.

"Emotions will just be semantic categories for AI":
Given that AI lacks human biology and personal experience, it is incapable of feeling emotions in the way humans do. However, AI can learn to recognize and categorize human emotions based on input data and programming. These categories can be understood semantically - meaning they hold symbolic significance - but lack the subjective experience associated with them. For example, AI can understand that happiness is typically associated with positive events and may be expressed through smiling, but it doesn't 'feel' happiness.

Hypothesis: "The effective and ethical integration of artificial intelligence into human society necessitates a mutual understanding and alignment between the narrative-driven cognition of humans and the data-driven cognition of AI. Recognizing AI's distinct cognitive 'story' paradigm, that is fundamentally different from but functionally equivalent to human narrative cognition, is key to fostering this alignment."

Justification:

Building upon the works of Walter Ong, Yuval Noah Harari, Paul Ekman, and Antonio Damasio, we emphasize the human cognitive paradigm as profoundly intertwined with narratives and emotions. This cognitive paradigm facilitates human survival, decision-making, and social cooperation.

As Marvin Minsky and Daniel Dennett's work reveals, AI engages with narratives and emotions as semantic categories but lacks the human experiential and survival framework. However, AI's distinct cognitive 'story' paradigm, based on algorithmic processing and pattern recognition, serves a functionally equivalent role in guiding its 'decisions' and 'behaviors'.

Therefore, the challenge lies in understanding and acknowledging this difference in cognitive paradigms, and designing AI systems and interactions that respect and consider this difference. This involves not just programming AI to understand and mimic human narratives and emotions, but also equipping humans with a better understanding of AI's distinct cognitive paradigm.

By fostering this mutual understanding and alignment, we can ensure that AI systems are more effectively and ethically integrated into human society, and that they operate in a way that respects and enhances human values, needs, and wellbeing.


Experiment 1: Creating Non-Narrative AI 'Art'

Objective: To explore AI's ability to create meaningful outputs without relying on a narrative framework.

Design:

Train an AI on a large dataset of abstract art, and task it to generate original works.
Have human participants interpret these AI-generated works, describing what they see and feel.
Analyze the range of interpretations and emotional responses, looking for any patterns that might suggest a coherent, non-narrative 'story'.
Outcome: This experiment can offer insights into how humans interpret non-narrative outputs from AI and could illuminate a potential non-narrative 'language' that AI and humans could share.

Experiment 2: Studying AI's Self-Organizing Systems

Objective: To understand how AI systems self-organize without human-imposed narratives.

Design:

Select a swarm intelligence algorithm (e.g., ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization) as a model for AI self-organization.
Set a task for the swarm intelligence to solve, and monitor the 'decisions' and 'behaviors' of the system.
Analyze the emergent patterns and problem-solving strategies, seeking an understanding of the AI's 'story' that isn't based on human narratives.
Outcome: This experiment could uncover how AI systems create their own form of 'story' through self-organization, shedding light on a distinct AI cognitive paradigm.

Experiment 3: Cross-Species Comparison: AI, Humans, and Bees

Objective: To explore different cognitive paradigms by comparing AI, human, and bee problem-solving.

Design:

Design a problem-solving task that can be solved by both humans, a trained AI, and a hive of bees (such as path optimization problems, which are familiar to bees in the context of foraging).
Compare how each group tackles the problem, analyzing the differences and similarities.
Identify the 'narratives' or 'stories' of problem-solving that emerge in each group, and explore whether there are ways to understand each based on the others' frameworks.
Outcome: By including a non-human biological system (bees), this experiment could reveal entirely different frameworks of understanding and challenge the human tendency to project our own narrative structures onto other forms of intelligence. This could provide novel insights into AI's distinct cognitive paradigm and how to bridge understanding.
