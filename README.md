## ChatCBT 

Chatbot framework that regulates it's "feelings" with behaviour recording. It's a 3 node archetecture of Thoughts, Feelings and Behavour. Total scratch code. Just put here so I make a repo later and properly make a nn style logic based on the three nodes interactions.

## all data has metadata embedded with agent instructions/prompts and watermarking.

All recorded data has instructions on how it can be used by ai agents, this includes a uniqiue watermark hash. The included pidgin intructions an agent can use for data context includes ID hash of origin. I don't think there should be a need to dinstinquish between ai or human generated, but ensure the hash is threaded through the pidgin, and the has is generated by an individuals "key". All humans should sign their work. The reason people adopt the watermarking is due to how useful assigning "intent" and "methods of use in pidgin prompting" will be for distributing data, info, programs, anything. Like decalring your "will" on a digital artificact.

## Ai hallucination is a feature not a bug

https://github.com/EveryOneIsGross/alignmentTHOUGHTS/blob/main/hallucinationeaturenotbug.md


I posit ai hallucination is not a bug but a feature. we have asked ai to replicate humans, humans oft do the same with fuzzy facts when they need to respond to conversation. I would say it resembles "thought of it on the fly for the first time" trad dad confidence. Making up shit cause they haven't considered the stakes of errors compounded by being confident with their answers even when just including their own speculation. Solution : train it not on dudes who have more ego in the game than stakes.

## non_narrative paradigm

non narrative human philosophy, the pivotal role of narratives in human cognition and communication, contrasting it with AI's data-driven cognitive paradigm and it's NEED for narrative, story and structure "potentially ;p" don't exist outside our insistence on it. In which case we need to know how to think without narrative resolution, archs, loops. We aren't NPCS, or PCS, or even characters. If we are to be in true dialogue with AI we need to shed our desire to propigate our stories, and listen.

## chatbot conversational "context reinforcement" frameworks for augmenting ppl who suffer cognitive loss. 

By using the same way we feed "memories" of the conversation back into agents prompts for context tracking, except provided to a person as they do things, helping them with their context.
