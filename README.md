## Ai hallucination is a feature not a bug. 

https://github.com/EveryOneIsGross/alignmentTHOUGHTS/blob/main/hallucinationeaturenotbug.md


I posit ai hallucination is not a bug but a feature. we have asked ai to replicate humans, humans oft do the same with fuzzy facts when they need to respond to conversation. I would say it resembles "thought of it on the fly for the first time" trad dad confidence. Making up shit cause they haven't considered the stakes of errors compounded by being confident with their answers even when just including their own speculation.

## non_narrative paradigm

non narrative human philosophy, the pivotal role of narratives in human cognition and communication, contrasting it with AI's data-driven cognitive paradigm and it's NEED for narrative, story and structure "potentially ;p" don't exist outside our insistence on it. In which case we need to know how to think without narrative resolution, archs, loops. We aren't NPCS, or PCS, or even characters. If we are to be in true dialogue with AI we need to shed our desire to propigate our stories, and listen.

## Using chatbot conversational "context" frameworks for augmenting patients who suffer cognitive loss. 

By using the same way we feed "memories" of the conversation back into agents prompts for context tracking, except spoken or displayed to the patient as they do things, helping them with their context.
