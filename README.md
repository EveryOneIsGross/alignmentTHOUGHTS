## 2023 chakras proven to exist. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüí®üé§üï≥üõ∏

a weird stepping back moment about being of the body not the mind from getting shingles again (also a bit flu-y strange brained). attached python is just scratch for a nn~ish frame, probs drop in some llm per node and pipedreams my problems with it. now I have to worry about aligning my chakras too ü§π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüìéüï¥

## Token starvation stressor experiment

After watching too many Dr Michael Levin planarian videos I wanted to know what a starved ai brain would look like (its head didn't explodeü§Ø), and if it got useful. LLMs obvs don't work at extreme token limits (tho from model to model they seem to break in unique ways üîéüßê). ANYWAYS. This script uses single digit token limits and temp distribution. Then I got too lazy thinking "what is mean?", and just added another agent that can chat with the embedded data to analyse.

## ChatCBT 

Chatbot framework that regulates it's "feelings" with behaviour recording. It's a 3 node archetecture of Thoughts, Feelings and Behavour. Total scratch code. Just put here so I make a repo later and properly make a nn style logic based on the three nodes interactions.

## on metadata embedded with agent instructions/prompts to incentivise watermarking 

All recorded data has instructions on how it can be used by ai agents, this includes a uniqiue watermark hash. The included pidgin intructions an agent can use for data context includes ID hash of origin. I don't think there should be a need to dinstinquish between ai or human generated, but ensure the hash is threaded through the pidgin, and the has is generated by an individuals "key". All humans should sign their work. The reason people adopt the watermarking is due to how useful assigning "intent" and "methods of use in pidgin prompting" will be for distributing data, info, programs, anything. Like decalring your "will" on a digital artificact.

## on hallucinating

https://github.com/EveryOneIsGross/alignmentTHOUGHTS/blob/main/hallucinationeaturenotbug.md

hallucination is probs not a bug but a feature. we have asked ai to guess the next human token, humans oft do the same p2p with fuzzy facts when they {need} to respond to conversation. I would say it resembles "thought of it on the fly for the first time" trad dad confidence. Making up shit cause they haven't considered the {stakes} of errors compounded by being perceived as confident. Doing so even when their answers even are just including their own speculation.

## chatbot conversational "context reinforcement" frameworks for augmenting ppl who suffer cognitive loss. 

By using the same way we feed "memories" of the conversation back into agents prompts for context tracking, except provided to a person as they do things, helping them with their context.

## non_narrative paradigm

non narrative human philosophy, the pivotal role of narratives in human cognition and communication, contrasting it with AI's data-driven cognitive paradigm and it's NEED for narrative, story and structure "potentially ;p" don't exist outside our insistence on it. In which case we need to know how to think without narrative resolution, archs, loops. We aren't NPCS, or PCS, or even characters. If we are to be in true dialogue with AI we need to shed our desire to propigate our stories, and listen.
