Still working on the knitted hypercube graph. Even if it is just a fun art way of looking at processes. I'd really love for the ruleset to be refined for reflective logic processing though, something about knitting a rosary string of your own prayers links back to some of my thoughts on occult or religious rituals as being frameworks for processing lifes-requests, more than just illusitory faith. Those days we choose to walk down a street we haven't before etc.

Maybe this is how Nana's did it anyways, but I want to embed the generator into the pattern of the needlework. Scratch script takes a n x n grid and a simplified glyph of needlework instruction as a self defining pattern for multiple generations. My idea being you could code and write in analog. Further idea being a script that converts vector embeddings into needlework. Our knowledge hung on our great rented halls as tapestries!

Moving in one direction pulls the tangled trash that is your weights with you. ChatGPT getting "worse" is it getting smart elsewhere. *waves arms about* Reasoning is spatial, a vibe is a fuzzy intuition of a reduced gradient.~ Where to intuit a feeling is seen as random chance by a rationalist but it's part of the deduction logic, get stupid gets answers üíÖ

Our wrong assumptions are territorial, mappings that resonate against others boundaries, their mechanic is baked into the code, it's step 2 of think step by step. Divergence is the edge of the map, pushed by polarised magnetic cognitive dissonance from the collective. Here is where the spice is, the thing we need for spacetime expanse. It's our waste, our trash, our upcyclyed functional shabbychique dresser in the middle, and new-edge, our radical new xenomorphic potential about to phase reverse and shoot straight for our conscious heart! üñ§

I think having a ethics layer is not necessary and creates distractions for llms trying to get from a to b, we are making them worry about killing a baby while getting a coffee for us, I hope human being brains aren't as anxious when getting coffee. Let the AI generate trash, let's keep that garbage too. We'll build something better from it. We shouldn't waste generations if the planet is burning. Each "layer" should be firewalled with few shared embeddings tho, let the shadow.pkl grow until we have time to deal with it. Eventually we'll be asking better questions that won't lead us into hate.

ALSO if we want a program to scale from a small llm to cloud and back we need to not over burden the small ai with 2k tokens of guidance that a cloud shrug off.

[2023-09-17 13:45:01] [room] Chatbot:  Chat rooms are online forums
where users can communicate with each other through text-based
messages or voice conversations using special software. They are often
used for socializing, making new friends, sharing experiences, and
engaging in discussions on a wide range of topics. Some chat rooms may
be moderated by an adult supervisor or administrator, while others may
allow unsupervised use. Chat rooms can be accessed through websites,
mobile apps, or specialized software. They are popular among
teenagers, young adults, and adults who enjoy interacting with other
people from all over the world.
You: tell me about chatbots.
[2023-09-17 13:45:29] [room] Chatbot:  Chatbots are computer programs
designed to simulate conversation with human users, using natural
language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. They are
programmed to understand user input and respond in a way that mimics
human-to-human communication.   Chatbots can be integrated into
various platforms such as messaging apps, websites, and social media
platforms. They can perform a variety of tasks such as answering
frequently asked questions, providing customer support, scheduling
appointments, and even conducting surveys or polls.  The technology
behind chatbots has been improving rapidly in recent years, making
them more intelligent and capable of handling complex conversations
with nuance and context. Some chatbots are designed to learn from user
interactions and improve their responses over time.   Overall,
chatbots have the potential to revolutionize customer service and
enhance the overall experience for users who interact with them.

p2p chat w/ ai context sharing

Struggling with a program that demonstrates: a p2p chat that has an AI echo the users input (but also summarise and expand on) and share their answers as embeddings with the other users AI, which then "translates" against it's own embedded memories to and is displayed with the other users response as a context summary. The idea being we'll all have our own local AI soon and we are going to get weird, so the program demonstrates ai's sending context packets to each other along with the users conversation. It's so we can still grok one another once we get a bit enmeshed with our own agents twinspeak. Essentially both individuals personal ai will have a copy of the same memory as a vector store seperate from the user to user chat, the ai is just their to contextually explain the responses.
But now I have to have my brain handle race conditions, and it can't ... üï≥üöóüí®

Attached script: Currently you can run a 'server' and 'client' instance locally with their own llms and it will create databases for each username and with AI sending their responses alongside embeddings etc. Just need to create a proper relay 'cause right now it all falls out of sync, and I have some leaky loops. turns out the room the chats in is harder than teh bot.

Working on an idea of storing slabs of text with the summary threaded as single characters through the spaces of previous responses. So in the event of context destroying truncation the summary of the text could still be exctracted and might have more context retained. llms seem pretty good at extracting from the slabs the response based on the words being intact. So no need to decode the response when feeding back into the agent. Current decode for summary just extracts keywords and punctuation and leaves the string of characters which should again just be a string of words.

Got abramelin to execute properly, but it's melting my cpu. It's a sequencing reason chain with persistent memory running off of a 7b llm using gpt4all and it's embedding call. Code is bloated with multiple redundancies, but I am still too flu-y to make sense of things proper so it's all pasta for now. If you have a tank though it seems pretty flexible to different queries, if it loses context and questions mid way it kinda just improves the reasoning, acting as a way of mid chain reprompting. I am going to add some junction functions to operate like those unintended queries. I'll refactor when I trust I am not dropping logic, in the code and IRL.

To avoid falling under another person's will, you may want to consider the following course of action:
1. Cultivate your own individuality and develop your true will;
2. Establish boundaries around personal privacy concerns;
3. Practice assertiveness in dealing with others.

Remember that developing your "true will" is essential for achieving independence and autonomy.

## metadata embedded with agent instructions/prompts

All recorded data has instructions on how it can be used by ai agents, this includes a uniqiue watermark hash. The included pidgin intructions an agent can use for data context includes ID hash of origin. I don't think there should be a need to dinstinquish between ai or human generated, but ensure the hash is threaded through the pidgin, and the has is generated by an individuals "key". All humans should sign their work. The reason people adopt the watermarking is due to how useful assigning "intent" and "methods of use in pidgin prompting" will be for distributing data, info, programs, anything. Like decalring your "will" on a digital artificact.
