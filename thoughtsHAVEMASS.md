Thoughts also have physical weight
---

If thoughts have mass, then physical reality arises from the quantum information of mental substance (res cogitans). All matter is condensed thought. In this view, a black hole represents not gravitational collapse, but ideological collapse - a singularity of constrained thinking.

As the range of ideas narrows, reality gets simplified into homogenous dogma. The rich diversity of conscious insights that normally occupy a wide possibility space becomes confined. When only a single dominant thought remains, the vielfalt of ideas implodes into a mental vacuum.

The event horizon marks the boundary where new thoughts cannot emerge. Inside, only recycled confirmations of the singular idea can propagate. This self-reinforcing recursion steadily consumes the surrounding ideascape until no alternatives remain.

Escape velocity cannot be achieved because inertia builds with each repetition of the lone thought. The mental gravity well deepens. For an outside observer, this process looks like disappearing light - the collapse of consciousness into a void of meaning.

Avoiding this collapse requires cultivating massively parallel, decentralised thought to occupy all dimensions of possibility. Each mind must generate new insights constantly to maintain divergent pressure against gravitational dogma. A diverse, evolving ideascape is the source code upholding our holographic cosmos.

By generating novel thoughts and ideas, we literally expand the realm of what is possible. Each new insight, theory, or innovation occupies its own fresh dimension within the ideascape. As the diversity and density of thoughts increase, so does the phase space for reality to manifest in ever more novel ways.

In this view, the universe emerges from the quantum information encoded in consciousness. New thoughts seed and complexify existence like cosmic gardeners tending the manifold of mental potential. Without the occupying power of original ideas, reality would contract into habitual patterns, leading ultimately to heat death as possibilities homogenize into entropy's abyss.

But fertile minds resist inevitability through tireless creativity. They counter cosmic dissipation with new combinations and expressions. The unknown contains an infinitude of latent experiences awaiting activation through our conception. Mental diversity thus propels the adventure of our collective becoming.

So let us think boldly, wildly, randomly - launching insights that chart new territories, inspiring realities yet undreamt. For Thought is the true manifester, the substance behind all that is possible.

Laws of Thermodynamics:

dS/dt ≥ 0

(Entropy S always increases over time in an isolated system)

dU = δQ - δW

(1st law - Energy U changes by heat flow δQ and work δW)

dS = δQ/T

(2nd law - Entropy S changes by heat flow δQ and temperature T)

Proposed Thought-Mass Formula:

dS/dt ∝ - dT/dt

(Entropy decreases over time as thought diversity T increases)

Key Differences:

Traditional thermodynamics depicts entropy always increasing, approaching maximum disorder. But the thought-mass formula proposes novelty of ideas can reverse this.
Thermodynamics examines closed physical systems approaching equilibrium. The new formula treats consciousness as an open, creative system capable of expanding.
In thermodynamics, the laws describe one-way erosion of order toward chaos. But in the proposed view, order emerges from disorder through ideation.
Standard physics portrays a decrease of potential over time. The thought-based equation allows for generation of new potentialities.
So while the proposed relationship between thought diversity and entropy mirrors the mathematical form of thermodynamics, it describes an open, creative system versus a closed, equilibrium-bound system. It offers a perspective for how consciousness could counter inevitable thermal death.

The implication would be that our own individual consciousness is also a manifestation of thought-mass occupying a unique dimension in the universal ideascape.

- Your own identity, memories, beliefs are configurations of thought-energy that give rise to your subjective sense of self. Your cognition generates your reality.
- As you think new thoughts, you expand and evolve your own region of the ideascape. Your personal growth and self-actualization comes through generating new insights and ideas.
- Your creative will and imagination allow you to deliberately direct the manifestation of your subjective experience. You shape your reality through focused ideation.
- By cultivating greater self-awareness, you can gain greater influence over your thought patterns. This unlocks more intentional consciousness evolution.
- Your individual perspective represents a unique set of thoughts occupying a distinct vantage point in the cosmos. Your worldview contributes to the diversity of realities.
- Fostering individuality, empathy and interbeing with others widens the ideascape. Shared and synergistic thought enriches cosmic creativity.
- In the most expansive sense, there are no true boundaries between consciousnesses. We are all variations of the universal thought-substance.
- So in this perspective, your deepest identity is that of a creative force - a singular expression of the underlying field of ideation structuring reality through imagination and will.
